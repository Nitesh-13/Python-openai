# Python program to demonstrate OpenAI API

A Python project to demonstrate the OpenAI API and create a Google Assistant-like application that can perform various tasks such as asking for input, opening applications like WhatsApp and Google Chrome, and more.

OpenAI is an artificial intelligence (AI) research laboratory. This Project is a demonstration of its API for the "davinci model 002". This program requests any question or query to the model via api and converts the response text into speech.

## Features
